## Features  
- **Dynamic Neural Network Architecture**  
- **Forward and Backward Propagation Implementation**  
- **Model Training and Performance Evaluation**  
- **Visualizations of Training Progress**  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- PyTorch  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

## How to Use  
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Install the required dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install torch numpy matplotlib
